# Part : 1
# Task Assignment: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Programming in C#
# Objective:
To demonstrate understanding and practical application of synchronous and asynchronous programming in C# by creating a single console application that includes both synchronous and asynchronous operations. This application will simulate data fetching and processing to highlight the differences between the two execution models.

# Task Description:
You are tasked with creating a console application in C# that performs data fetching and processing operations in both synchronous and asynchronous manners.

# Part : 2 
# Task Assignment: Delegates and Functions in C#
# Objective:
